jeffjuann.com - V2 is the second iteration of my personal portfolio website built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), powered by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Technologies

this website is build with Astro Static Site Generation (SSG) API. this API allows us to build a website and generate it as a static site to achieve better performance and load time. 

TailwindCSS is used to style the website. TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build a website faster and easier.

Vercel is used to host the website. Vercel is a cloud platform that allows us to deploy our website easily and quickly.

## Development

for more information, you can visit the [Github Repository](https://github.com/jeffjuann/v3.jeffjuann.com/)

## Future Works

I plan to add contentful integration to make it easier to update the content of the website without update the repo.
