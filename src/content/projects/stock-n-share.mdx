**Stock 'n Share** is an innovative mobile application designed to combat food waste by facilitating food donations and supporting food banks. Although still in the conceptual stage, this app aims to create a sustainable and efficient platform where individuals and organizations can donate surplus food to those in need.

## What Stock 'n Share Does

Stock 'n Share focuses on achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Number 2: Zero Hunger. By reducing food waste and ensuring that surplus food reaches those who need it, the app plays a vital role in combating hunger and promoting food security.

Stock 'n Share operates by providing users with information about the nearest food banks. This proximity-based approach ensures that food donations are efficiently directed to locations where they can be immediately utilized, minimizing waste and maximizing impact.

## Development

Stock 'n Share is developed by a team of three individuals who participated in a UI/UX competition where the project achieved as a Finalist, highlighting its focus on functionality and societal impact. Stock 'n Share remains a conceptual project and currently does not have plans for further development.
