**Nutrisense** is a mobile application designed to scan foods and calculate their nutritional content. By leveraging the camera, the app detects foods and provides detailed nutritional information, aiming to promote healthier eating habits. Nutrisense is developed and built by [PotatoKentang](https://github.com/PotatoKentang).

## Why Nutrisense ?

Nutrisense is designed to assist users, particularly children, in efficiently calculating the nutritional value of their meals. By simply using the camera, the app can identify various foods and calculate their nutrition, making it easier for individuals to maintain a balanced diet and monitor their health.

In addition to food scanning, Nutrisense offers two main features:

1. **Manual Nutrition Calculation:** This feature allows users to manually input food items to calculate their nutritional values. It is particularly useful for foods that the camera may not detect accurately.
2. **Health and Diet News and Articles:** This section provides users with the latest news and articles related to health and nutrition, offering valuable insights and tips to support a healthy lifestyle.

Nutrisense's comprehensive approach helps users make informed dietary choices and encourages a greater awareness of nutritional intake.

## Technologies Behind Nutrisense

Nutrisense utilizes the YOLOv8 model to detect foods and calculate their nutritional content. Trained on a vast dataset of food images from around the world, Nutrisense achieves high accuracy in food detection, ensuring reliable and precise nutritional information.

The mobile application is built with React Native and Expo, which enable faster and more efficient development. React Native allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React, ensuring compatibility with both Android and iOS platforms. Expo further streamlines the development process by providing a set of tools and services for React Native apps.

Nutrisense was rigorously tested to ensure its accuracy. The development team performed extensive evaluations on Android devices to confirm the app's performance and reliability. We used real-world scenarios and a variety of food items to validate its functionality.
