Nutrnsense is a mobile application built by team [PotatoKentang](https://github.com/PotatoKentang). The purpose of our mobile app is to prevent malnutrition by providing necessary information about nutrition. Nutrisense utilizes the power of YOLOv8 to detect foods. after detecting the food, the app will provide information about the nutrition of the food.

Alongside with the Food Recognition Feature, Our app has two more main features:
- **Nutrition Calculator**: The nutrition calculator can be used through the UI or text-based, and it calculates the total nutrition of the foods/ingredients.
- **Blog Section**: The blog section provides blogs about malnutrition.

## Development

Nutrisense is built using React Native with Expo and YOLOv8. By using React Native with Expo, we can build a mobile application that can run on both Android and iOS (tested in Android only). and The YOLOv8 Model is used to detect the food in the camera.
